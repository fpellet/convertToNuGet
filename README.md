# ConvertToNuGet

Allows to convert dll to nuget package and not add dll file in repository.

This can be useful if you use DevExpress for example. Indeed, it only provides dlls.

This project is inspired by https://github.com/caioproiete/DevExpress-NuGet and https://gist.github.com/smoothdeveloper/994522269a0a04c275c9
